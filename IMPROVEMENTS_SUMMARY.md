### 2. Scientifically-Based Feature Engineering
Based on the research paper "Shallow subsurface water-ice distribution in the lunar south polar region: analysis based on Mini-RF and multi-metrics", we implemented:

#### Radar Metrics (5 channels):

- **m (Degree of Polarization)**: <0.2 for volume scattering associated with water-ice
- **σLH0 (Horizontal Backscatter Coefficient)**: <-15 dB for water-ice
- **δ (Relative Phase)**: 0°<δ<80° or 100°<δ<180° for water-ice
- **w (Weighted Power Enhancement)**: 0.5-1.0 for water-ice enrichment

#### Environmental Metrics (3 channels):
- **Terrain Roughness**: Fractal dimension analysis to distinguish true ice from rough surfaces
- **Annual Average Illumination**: <0.2 for PSRs (Permanently Shadowed Regions)
- **Annual Maximum Temperature**: <110K for water-ice preservation

### 3. Advanced Training Pipeline
- **Early Stopping**: Increased patience to 15 epochs for better convergence
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Aggressive reduction (factor=0.2) with patience=7
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Added precision and recall monitoring alongside accuracy
- **Data Generation**: Realistic simulation of ice/non-ice samples with appropriate metric values

### 4. Enhanced Evaluation Framework

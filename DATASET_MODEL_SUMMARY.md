- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Learning rate reduction for fine-tuning
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Model persistence with saving/loading capabilities

### 4. Visualization Outputs
All visualization files successfully generated in `data/models/`:
1. **[dataset_training_history.png](data/models/dataset_training_history.png)** - Training and validation accuracy/loss curves
2. **[dataset_confusion_matrix.png](data/models/dataset_confusion_matrix.png)** - Confusion matrix visualization
